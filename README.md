Streamflow is an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)-powered desktop application for watching your favorite Twitch streamers without any downtime. In other words, Streamflow automatically shifts to your next favorite online streamer when the one you're watching goes offline. Perfect for putting on in the background for long study sessions or chores.
